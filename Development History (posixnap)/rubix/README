            Rubil's Cube Solver
        by Matt Harrington

    To use this project, follow the instructions in INSTALL.

Files:

bin/puzzle.pl:
        This file runs the rubik's solver.  It will ask for
    input on the initial cube to solve then attempt to solve
    it.  It is is solvable, it will display instructions on
    how to solve it.  If not it will give you a smartass
    answer.

cubes/example_cube.txt:
        This is a sample cube file.  For those lazy people
    who do not want to type, you can do this:
    
            bin/puzzle.pl < cubes/example_cube.txt

    This will run the solver on the cube found in the file.
    Running the puzzle.pl program once will give you an idea
    of what a cube file would look like...

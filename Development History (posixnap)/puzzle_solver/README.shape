bin/test_shape_container.pl:
        This file reads data from a preprogrammed file
    to generate a shape and several points.  This file
    is denoted by the constant `DATAFILE' and is set to
    `example_files/file1.txt' by default.  This file
    contains several line descriptions which are used
    to create the shape.  The point descriptions are
    read as simple point objects.  This program tests
    if these point objects are contained within the
    specified shape.

DR: 	The PoogleSolitaire modules need significant cleansing.

MH:	i am not sure Neopets::Shops::Item or Neopets::Shops::Mine::Item
	have a use anymore.. is there a reason for keeping these?

# XXX: tonight
MH:	abstract training ( setup pet modules )
-> MH:	the pet module is worky

# XXX: tonight
MH:	work on tombola module

AA:     Neopets::MITraining . able to send pets to training. could be used
		with the wizard to actually buy items and send pets to school to get
                leveled up.
-> this is done. aa.

MH:     write better N::Config errors
-> MH:  done to the best of my experience..

MH:     create config setup where xml files are directly translatable into
        arrays of $item objects
-> MH:  this is done, see Neopets::Config and Neopets::Config::*
	see Neopets::Config::example for api
-> MH:  this config aspect is being fazed out of the project in favor
        of more intelligent problem solving

AA:	the setprice script (or, rather, the modules it calls) should die 
		with an error if there is nothing in the shop. at present, it just
		proceeds and there is no form to parse, so it warns loudly about uninit
		vars.
-> MH:	i believe this is done

AA: regression tests are badly needed. we should start a t/ dir like the rest
	of the cpan modules do, and use it for regression testing. i.e., t/train.t, t/neopoints.t ...

AA: examples/wizard.pl should be hacked to understand a lack of np at this point.
	i'm inclined to actually put the np checking into the buy() method. however, that
	means that we grab one new page for every item we buy. since we're focusing on speed
	with the wizard, and this program is running on slowish machines, it might not be
	the greatest idea to do that. rather, to check the np once, and actively reduce the
	value of $NP or whatever. the problem with this is that $NP can increase if, for example,
	i empty the till while the wizard is doing (which i frequently do to avoid going broke).
	the bloatpig is starting to crush its smaller minions.

AA: i'd like a moneytree neopoints donation method. it would also be nice to have
	an item class that understood a ->donate() method.

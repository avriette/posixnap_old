=item Legacy Modules

Somebody needs to go through and discern which modules do 
things which could be blocking, and put them somewhere so
they can be made non-blocking. By the same token, somebody 
needs to take the modules which aren't blocking, like the
BSD::Resource ('pig') module, and simply put it somewhere
we know we can use it without fear of having it block the
rest of the application.

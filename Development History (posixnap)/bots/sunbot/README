## Installation notes.

I'm not a technical writer but here goes:

databot.pl: Run this on your sun solaris servers 'nohup perl databot.pl'

datacheck.pl: Run this on your data collection point I use cron.

addhost.pl: Use this to add hosts to your postgres database. 
	Syntax:
	./addhost.pl hostname
	
	* Hostname must be resolveable our you'll get an error.

inti.pl: Used to track server metrics through email.
	look at the config file (which should go in /etc/inti/config)

htdocs/ : These go in your apache directory. Please change database settings/


Which brings me to schema:

addhost.pl creates a table for each host in the database you specify in the dbi line.

Warranty:
There is no warranty if it newfs' your disks, trashes your files, kills your dog, or causes the destruction of life as we know it, tough titty.

You probably want to compile postgres and perl exactly the same way
so that the environment you use for all your modules is consistent.
It is also therefore easier to write a shell script to set up your
environment for you.

Note that these are instructions for 5.8.0 and above. 5.6.x and
below are probably missing some of the modules which are omitted
herein from the core.

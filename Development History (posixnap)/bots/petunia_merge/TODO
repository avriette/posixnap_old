AA:	Probably another lib::Regex::Common module (i.e., Neopets) would
		be real useful here.

		rating: not deemed useful, but if you want to implement it, thats cool.

AA:	an automatic ban clearer.

		rating: useful. anyone willing to do it should read POCO::IRC.

AA:	the personality module. (dont ask)

		rating: only alex can write this.

AA: live cutover for databases using evildbh.

		rating: requires project goals change. probably ignore this.

AA: reloading utility on the fly. boot() and kick().

		rating: requires project goals change. probably ignore this.

AA: math module.

		rating: useful. not criticial.

AA: units module.

		rating: useful. not criticial.

AA: cc module (country code)

		rating: useful. not criticial.

AA: let's take cc, ipmap, and netcraft and just make an iptools.pm.

AA: probably the "new" utility stuff should be merged into the test suite.
		At present it is impossible to test changes to the petunia framework without
		restarting the bot.

		rating: critical

AA: RE: PREVIOUS: THIS REALLY, REALLY, REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE. SOMEBODY BE AN ANGEL AND DO IT.

		rating: critical

AA: pollute is not quite working.

		rating: requires project goals change. probably ignore this.

AA: if you pass a dsn thats broken (eg dbi:Pg:dbname=botdb_elvis;dbhost=goro-i.putar)
		its fatal in dbi. we need to eval that call so we dont die. and, make sure to tell
		the user all the $@ goodness.

		rating: requires project goals change. probably ignore this.

AS: date.pm gets triggered when pasting headers of RCS logs

		rating: moderate. this should be fixed. it seems simple enough.

AS: btw the bot still doesn't have its own consciousness

		rating: useful. the 'personality' module should come close. however if
		andreas wishes to be 'digitized' into the bot, he has another thing coming.

AA: bug in select_map... bot pings out when big queries are issued.

		rating: async.pm should fix this.

AA: the bot needs to know it has to reconnect when it gets kicked.

		rating: critical: this is an easy fix.

AA: the bot has to know about alternative servers.

		rating: critical: this is an easy fix.

AA: the bot has to understand that Broker::Config can have arrays.
		tell danris about this.

		rating: moderate. danris won't listen. Broker::Config::Hash. or..
		DBI::Easy::Hash and DBI::Easy::Array. Alex may fix this.

AA: merge :metar with weather.pm. however, weather.pm needs a new parser.

		rating: boring but easy.

AA: I'm unfucking andreas' stuff. ive got market and karma appearing to be
		doing their own database stuff, but i havent run them through -c etc.
		lets hope the bot doesnt crash. :x

		rating: only andreas or alex can fix this. either way it is difficult.

AA: handle irc_ctcp_action. duh. reading docs++

		rating: moderate: could be easy for the right programmer. read the pod for
		poco::irc. that should explain.

AA: karma is broken. --

<xex> hummus++
<xex> hummus++
<xex> :karma hummus
<petunia> hummus has 3 karma
<xex> hummus++ hummus++ hummus++
<xex> :karma hummus
<petunia> hummus has 4 karma

that should be fixed so it can process multiple entries.

		rating: isnt this fixed?

AA: quake.pm needs to change:

<petunia> This Bulletin is updated every 5 minutes, if necessary.  The same Bulletin 
<petunia> is also available via the Internet at:
<petunia> http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/bulletin/bulletin.html and that is the
<jimmy> wtf?
<petunia> preferred means of obtaining it.
<petunia> Updated as of Tue Mar 4 16:48:50 GMT 2003.

		rating: isnt this fixed?

AA: it would be good if the auto-op functions could display the oplist and accept
		new op lists from the channel. i'm gonna put ben on this. (and delete them)

		rating: easy

AA: :sell does not go to notice, it does /msg. this is annoying in xchat.

		rating: easy

AA: petunia needs a "portability suite." here's the example scenario. i move from
		one machine to another because im going offline. i want to be able to export
		every row from every table to a file, and import them on the next machine. 
		pg_dump has proved *woefully inadequate*. the first step would just be something
		that propagated the "new data" to the "old database" without "stomping" on "old
		data". alex could probably work on this some and commit it.

		rating: hard

AA: I really want the stuff that is prefixed with XXX: fixed. or just examined.

		rating: easy per module but hard overall

AA: the bot has to know when it isnt opped, and to ask politely to be opped when
		it isnt opped.

		rating: moderate

AA: petunia needs a singing module. damnit.

AA: merge doesnt seem to be working.

AA: <Jerub> ~+hehstats
<php-bot> total count of heh on #php: 536.  Top 3: HolyGoat -- 109 (20.3%), Stephanie -- 40 (7.5%), erps -- 38 (7.1%)

AA: i like purl's approach to seen:

<cwest> purl, seen coraline
<purl> coraline was last seen on #perl 23 minutes and 21 seconds ago, saying: brevity: no, as in why it existed [Thu May 29 04:15:27 2003]

if purl has seen them on the channel it is being asked on, it leaves the channel off.
